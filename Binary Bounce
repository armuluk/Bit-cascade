Not sure which name to use: Binary Bounce, or Bit Cascade

-------------------

Have to guide the bit down (using left/right) and place it where required – may overwrite an existing bit
If player does not stop the bit it bounces when it hits the bottom and then will go upwards (still can be controlled) but will stop as soon as it is in a space (so paralleling the tetris idea) – if the spot at the bottom where it bounces is free then it will stop there
If the eight bits all present and equal to number on right then row disappears
New rows push up from below
Lose when any bit reaches top row

Could have hex on right hand side
Could have longer bit strings coming off the cascade
Bit cascade at the top pushes them along/off at a rate that gets faster?

Limitation  - won’t work the other way (calcing decimal from a full binary string)
